Source of the original:  https://static-oforms.onlyoffice.com/software_development_agreement_1f7d063469.pdf

## Summary of the Change
This amendment revises the **Limitation of Liability** provision to introduce a clear monetary
liability cap while preserving critical customer protections through explicit carve-outs.

## Original Clause (Before Amendment)
**Section 14 – Limitation of Liability** stated that neither party would be liable for special,
indirect, incidental, or consequential damages. However, the clause did **not** define any
monetary cap on direct damages and did not include explicit exceptions.

## Amended Clause (After Amendment)
**Section 14 is deleted and replaced in its entirety** with a new limitation of liability clause
that:

1. Introduces a **liability cap** equal to the total fees paid or payable in the twelve (12)
   months preceding the event giving rise to the claim.
2. Preserves the exclusion of indirect, incidental, consequential, and punitive damages.
3. Adds **explicit carve-outs** so that the liability cap does *not* apply to:
   - Breaches of confidentiality (Section 12)
   - Indemnification obligations (Section 13)
   - Willful misconduct or gross negligence


## Sections Impacted
- **Section 14 – Limitation of Liability** (fully replaced)

## Pages Impacted
- **Page 5 of 7** of the original Software Development Agreement, where Section 14 appears.


## Legal and Practical Impact
- Provides predictable risk exposure for both parties
- Aligns liability with the economic value of the contract
- Preserves customer protection for high-risk scenarios
- Brings the agreement in line with modern SaaS and software services standards

## Net Effect
The amendment materially changes the risk allocation between the parties by capping exposure
while maintaining accountability for confidentiality breaches, indemnification claims, and
intentional or reckless misconduct.
