## Summary of Change
This amendment strengthens and clarifies the **Obligations of the Manufacturer** by adding
explicit requirements related to quality assurance, regulatory compliance, and subcontracting.

## What Changed
The amendment introduces three new obligations:
1. **Quality Assurance** – Mandatory quality control systems and audit rights for the Buyer.
2. **Regulatory Compliance** – Explicit obligation to comply with all applicable laws and standards.
3. **Subcontracting Restriction** – Manufacturer may not subcontract without Buyer consent.

## Sections Impacted
- **Section: Obligations of the Manufacturer** (amended to add new subsections)

## Pages Impacted
- **Pages 3–4** of the original contract, where the "Obligations of the Manufacturer" section
  appears in the International Manufacturing Contract template.

## Legal Impact
These changes increase Buyer oversight, reduce regulatory risk, and limit Manufacturer
operational delegation, materially increasing Manufacturer responsibility under the Agreement.
